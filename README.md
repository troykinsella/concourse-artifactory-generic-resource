# concourse-artifactory-resource

A Concourse CI resource for publishing generic artifacts to Artifactory.

One of the following version strategies can be configured:

| Version Strategy | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `none`   | The resource does not manipulate any versions. The `check` and `in` operations are no-ops, and the `put` operation allows you to publish one or more files to a repository path. This configuration is suitable for simply publishing files to Artifactory, but it not suitable if any downstream jobs need to react (i.e. `trigger: true`) to changes to a published file. 
| `single-file` | This strategy treats a changing sha256 sum of a single file as a version stream. This is appropriate when only a single file name is manipulated, and a publication can overwrite a previous one of the same name/path.


## Source Configuration

* `url`: Required. The URL at which the Artifactory instance can be reached. Example: `https://tools.example.com/artifactory`.
* `repository`: Required. The name of the generic repository in Artifactory. Example: `generic-local`.
* `api_key`: Required. The API key with which to publish artifacts.
* `version_strategy`: Optional. The strategy by which to handle versioning. Default: `none`.
* `path`: When the `version_strategy` is:
  * `none`: Optional. Denotes a directory path under the `repository` in which files will be published.
  * `single-file`: Required. The path to the single file to manipulate, relative to `repository`.

## Behaviour

### `check`

The behaviour depends on the configured `version_strategy`:
* `none`: No-op.
* `single-file`: Checks the `sha256sum` value of the configured file, and treats it as the version.

### `in`

The behaviour depends on the configured `version_strategy`:
* `none`: No-op.
* `single-file`: Fetch the latest artifact file, validating the expected `sha256sum` version produced by `check`.
  As Artifactory does not support a "file change history" API, only the latest file publication can be understood by this configuration,
  which means that it cannot operate on `every` changed version.

#### Parameters

* `skip_download`: Optional. Default: `false`. Do not download the artifact file when `true`.

### `out`: Publish artifacts to Artifactory

The behaviour depends on the configured `version_strategy`:
* `none`: Any files found in the `param.files` directory that match the optional `glob` pattern 
  will be published to the given `source.path` under the `source.repository` in Artifactory.
* `single-file`: A single file named `source.path` 

#### Parameters

* `files`: Required. The path to a directory containing files to publish.
* `glob`: Optional. Default: `*`. A glob expression of the file names to match
  for publication. Only relevant to the `none` version strategy.
